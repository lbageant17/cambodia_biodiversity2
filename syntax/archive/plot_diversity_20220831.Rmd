**Things we could explore:**

* *Which species and how much of them "make it through" from biomonitoring to catch to people's plates?* Schematic below. 
  * Given that people are consuming some of virtually all of the species they catch, I suspect this the list of species that make it through to people's plates will be long unless there are a lot of species that are simply never or hardly caught. 
  * Based on the figures above, we might expect the "how much" element of the question to be more interesting unless there is variation on other dimensions though--e.g., seasonally, by CFR type, by initial CFR diversity level, or by household characteristics.

* *How seasonal are these dynamics?* It may be that in certain seasons, some species are exclusively sold (or eaten), which we would not see in the aggregate analysis above. It may also be that some species are completely non-existent in the system and/or data in some seasons, but not in others.

* *How spatial are these dynamics?* It may be that in certain CFR areas, some species are exclusively sold (or eaten), but we wouldn't see that in the aggregate analysis above. One starting point for exploring this would be to look at above graphs by the 4 CFR types and see how they differ.

* *How do these relationships differ by household characteristics?* It may be that some types of households exclusively eat their fish while others sell it, or it may be that all households are both consuming and engaging in the market. 

* *Are there species that we could identify (using other sources) as high-value in the market?* Where do those species sit within these figures?

* Very difficult to know, but important to keep in mind: To what degree is the decision to eat vs. sell dependent on marketing opportunities vs. preferences. I'm not sure we can really get at this in these data, but we should be thinking about it.
